# Devlog

## 17th November
We can't use similar looking game assets from older games so the idea of taking elements from games I've loved growing up is out the window (T.T)

Given that so much of the time is already wasted, we've decided to make a shooter.

## 15th November
Morning brought a great sight. WoeUSB had completed successfully, installed Win while I got ready for work. Success!

After work, opened MS Edge to download Chrome, installed Unity Hub and all supporting software that I'd need. Typing this on my Win10.

## 14th November

I didn't want to continue dev on the mac. It's fans were going crazy and it's old and potentially close to it's EOL. The desktop has far better specs anyway.

Turns out unity doesn't officially support linux, so I had to bite the bullet and install windows on my desktop again.

Writing the bootable USB win10 image from mac wasn't easy. Ubuntu did slightly better. WoeUSB was taking too long to copy files into the USB drive, I just went to sleep halfway through the copying.

## 12th November

Switched the fuel texture to Voxel from MagicaVoxel.

Given how intuitive MagicaVoxel is, I think more of this game is going to be voxels now :)

## 11th November

Started blender and made a icosphere. First time using blender so :shrug:

Camera control took forever to build. Solar charging, fuel depletion mechanic is up. FTW!

Nights look fugly, I tried to hack the sun and turn it into a moon, but that looked even uglier.

Made a look alike of old ass fuel tank from road fighter. Will use it to add some fuel to the bot.

After making the butterfly controller, it feels like this game is gonna be too big for the weekends scope.

Now we need to switch to something else.

## 4th November

Finally got time to look at the theme and think of some ideas with Poonam.

Making a hybrid out of a dog was pretty straight-forward, "cyborg dog" fits.

- We came up with a bunch of ideas, discarded most
- Set up this repo
- Added some placeholders for dog and robot
- Added a simple mouse gun controller

## Backstory

I bought some unity assets and a course in a humble bundle. I've finished most of the course over Oct 2018, made a couple of simple tutorial-ish games and am kinda teaching Poonam now.

We have a dog named Beastie and we love her to bits. We wanted to make a game based on her quirky attitude.

I saw an announcement for Github Game off 2018 and decided to participate for fun.
