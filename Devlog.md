# Devlog

## 4 November

Finally got time to look at the theme and think of some ideas with Poonam.

Making a hybrid out of a dog was pretty straight-forward, "cyborg dog" fits.

- We came up with a bunch of ideas, discarded most
- Set up this repo
- Added some placeholders for dog and robot
- Added a simple mouse gun controller

## Backstory

I bought some unity assets and a course in a humble bundle. I've finished most of the course over Oct 2018, made a couple of simple tutorial-ish games and am kinda teaching Poonam now.

We have a dog named Beastie and we love her to bits. We wanted to make a game based on her quirky attitude.

I saw an announcement for Github Game off 2018 and decided to participate for fun.
