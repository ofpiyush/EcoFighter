# HybridBot

Theme for GithubGameOff this year is *Hybrid*

## Core theme

### Low poly vs Voxel characters.

Voxels are polluting the environment and low poly character are fighting climate change.

## Lore
The arena is a happy low poly land. Pendu (player, icosphere) runs on solar power, roams around the arena planting bushes and keeping natural pollution levels in check.

Voxella (enemy, Voxel sphere) destroys bushes and keeps adding factories to maximise profit. Factories pollute the environment and drive the arena to extinction.

Pendu has to keep balance and survive the poisonous pollutants emitted from factories and Voxella.
