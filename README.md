### Theme interpretation
Player is a hybrid (organic brain + mechnical body) icosphere running on hybrid fuel (solar + charcoal) in a hybrid universe (low poly and voxel characters).

The game itself is a hybrid between a shooter and a management game. You've to keep pollution low and kill the enemy before time runs out!
