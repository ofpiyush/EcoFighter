# Robodog

Theme this year is *Hybrid*

## Core theme mechanics/ideas

- Robot + Dog hybrid
- Hybrid Control (Via treats). Player controls the robot, dog reacts to instinct + environmental stimulus.

- Genre hybrid: Pet simulation + mission?

## Throwing darts in the dark

Player controls the robot.

Dog gets distracted by objects in the game like butterflies, cats and food (potentially poisonous).

The dog starts as a puppy and you're fitted on top. Govt experiment (backstory needs work)

You've to survive and sniff bombs with the dog throughout it's lifespan (15 years, 1 year per minute. The entire game is 15 minutes long)

The mechanics available to player is 2 fold.

1. Projectile treats, dog instinctively chases it. This can be used to direct the dog or prevent it from chasing cats.
2. Diffuse the sniffed bombs (takes 5s?)

Other possible mechanics??

1. Shooting weapons, enemy animals, turrets etc can be shot at.
2. Can also use a training mechanic, where you make a sound(key press) while you dispense treats and dog associates the reward with the action it just performed. This would be forgotten over time unless re-inforced.

Constraints:

You have limited ammo and treat inventory and your aim is to live out the full life of a dog and sniff out as many bombs as you can.

Initially dog can be very energetic and distracted, in late game, the dog can get slow and might become forgetful etc.

The emotions we are trying to go for are:

1. Love for the dog.
2. Understanding that dogs are semi-trainable but follow their instincts.
3. Horror at the whole idea of using animals for war stuff (other fellow dead animals etc)
4. Sadness when the dog eventually dies.
