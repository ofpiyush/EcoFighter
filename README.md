Theme for Github Game Off this year is **Hybrid**

### Theme interpretation
Player is a hybrid (organic brain + mechnical body) icosphere running on hybrid fuel (solar + charcoal) in a hybrid universe (low poly and voxel characters).

The game itself is a hybrid between a shooter and a management game. You've to keep pollution low and kill the enemy before time runs out!

### How to play

Corporate greed has run the world to the brink of environmental collapse! You have to protect the rest of us from certain doom by planting bushes,


### Controls

Typical third person controller with mouse and arrow/WASD keys

Left click to shoot laser, Right click to throw seeds.
