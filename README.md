Theme for Github Game Off this year is **Hybrid**

### Theme interpretation
Player is a hybrid (organic brain + mechnical body) icosphere running on hybrid fuel (solar + charcoal) in a hybrid universe (low poly and voxel characters).

The game itself is a hybrid between a shooter and a management game. You've to keep pollution low and kill the enemy before time runs out!

### How to play

Corporate greed has run the world to the brink of environmental collapse! You have to protect the rest of us from certain doom by keeping pollution low and killing the enemy!


### Controls

Typical third person controller with mouse and arrow/WASD keys

Left click to shoot laser, Right click to throw seeds.
